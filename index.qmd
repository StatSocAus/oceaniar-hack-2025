We are excited to announce the next OceaniaR Hackathon day. This event is a 
chance to collaborate in-person on R-focused projects for social good, with some
of the leading developers in the R community. There will also be time to hold informal talks to share ideas, concepts and new packages for feedback.   

This event will have a focus on promoting projects and participation from R users in the Oceania region including Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. 

All project ideas will be listed as [Issues](https://github.com/StatSocAus/oceaniar-hack-2025/issues) on the project Github and decided on the day.
